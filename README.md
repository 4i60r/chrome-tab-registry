Chrome Tab Registry
===================

A tab registry library for use in Google Chrome extensions.

A problem when working with tabs in Google Chrome extensions is that there are situations in which 
don't retain a consistent ID. This library attempts to assign tabs a consistent and unique GUID
so they can be accurately identified and tracked.

The problem and a proposed solution are well explained on Stack Overflow: [Persistent unique ID for Chrome tabs that lasts between browser sessions](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11005258/persistent-unique-id-for-chrome-tabs-that-lasts-between-browser-sessions).

Usage

Known Limitations
-----------------
- Page load must get the the point where `ContentScript.js` is executed for tab to be recorded in the registry.
- Pages that can't have content scripts can't be registered (things like `chrome://` and `https://secure.google.com/` pages).
- There are also some [bugs](https://github.com/drzax/chrome-tab-registry/issues) which are due to limitations of the Extensions API. (If you have a solution to any of these bugs, please do contribute.)
